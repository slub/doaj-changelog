# DOAJ Changelog

The change log showing journals that have been withdrawn from the [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) (DOAJ) do not contain any publisher information. The aim of this project is to enrich these.

The final result of the enrichment process is available in [CSV](data/doaj_changelog_withdrawn_list_enriched_utf8.csv) and [XLSX](data/doaj_changelog_withdrawn_list_enriched_utf8.xlsx) format.

Please note that these files are UTF-8 encoded and that there is also an [ASCII](data/doaj_changelog_withdrawn_list_enriched_ascii.csv) version of the CSV file in which all characters outside the ASCII range are represented as Unicode escape sequences.
